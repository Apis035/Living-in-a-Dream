# Living in a Dream storyboard

Storyboard for [Asphyxia](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1715720)'s mapset [Quinn Karter - Living in a Dream (feat. Natalie Major) (Feint Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1602640)

Original storyboard by [-Ady](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4414426), I enchanced and added more things on top of his storyboard.

## Loading storyboard

[Storybrew](https://github.com/Damnae/storybrew) is needed to load this project. Download [here](https://github.com/Damnae/storybrew/releases/latest).

- Clone / [download](https://github.com/Apis035/living-in-a-dream-sb/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) project file
- Extract the zip content into **storybrew**'s `project` folder
- Copy `sb` folder inside into mapset folder
- Launch `StorybrewEditor.exe`, click on `Open project` and open `project.sbrew.yaml`
- When asked `The mapset folder cannot be found.` choose `ok` and select one of the beatmap's `.osu` file
- Storyboard loaded

To compile the storyboard into beatmap's `.osb` file, right click the puzzle icon on bottom right. (left clicking will make the circle highlight generated incorrectly)
